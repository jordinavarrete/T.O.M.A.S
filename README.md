# T.O.M.A.S

This app ensures comunication between an admin and all passengers in an airport, making it possible to transmit all flights critical data so pasengers are informed during a blackout. We used Bluetooth and Google Services Nearby API to create a device mesh, so the information gets transmitted peer to peer between users.

Since we both support Google's nearby and raw Bluetooth, we can guarantee the best experience between android-based devices, but interoperability with RAW bluetooth means that iOS devices (and perhaps even laptops and other bluetooth-enabled IoT devices) will also be able to be part of the offline map.

It was created for the HackUPC 2025 hackathon and it was the Vueling challenge. Created with Android Studio and Java.
