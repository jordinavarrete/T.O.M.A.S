# T.O.M.A.S

This app ensures comunication between an admin and all passengers in an airport, making it possible to transmit all flights critical data so pasengers are informed during a blackout. We used bluetooth to create a device mesh, so the information gets transmited peer to peer between users.

It was created for the HackUPC 2025 hackathon and it was the Vueling challenge. Created with Android Studio and Java.
